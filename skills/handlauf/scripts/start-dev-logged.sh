# Start the project's dev server with its output in a log file, for the handlauf skill.
# Run with run_in_background: the script stays alive as long as the server does, and
# prints READY once the health endpoint answers.

# Usage:  bash skills/handlauf/scripts/start-dev-logged.sh <logfile>
#
# Adapt to the project through environment variables, or copy the script into the
# project and hardcode them there:
#
#   HL_DIR           directory to run in            default: the repository root
#   HL_CMD           the dev server command         default: npm run dev
#   HL_PORT          port it listens on             default: 3000
#   HL_HEALTH        URL that answers 200 when up   default: http://localhost:$HL_PORT/
#   HL_BUILD_MARKER  a production build artifact     default: .next/BUILD_ID
#                    whose presence breaks dev mode; leave empty to skip the check
#
# Exit codes before start:
#   2  the port is already taken (somebody else's server; ask before stopping it)
#   3  a production build is in the way; dev mode would serve broken routes
